# Rebuild

Rebuild is a phone application aimed at creating open sourced building plans to build on the vacant lots in Detroit. To do this, anyone with the app could work on projects and architectural plans so that building ideas could be created free of charge. In doing my research, I realized that one of the major reasons why buildings werent going up in the vacant lots was that the government didn't want to put money into projects to rebuild lower socioeconomic status areas.
