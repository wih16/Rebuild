# Rebuild

Rebuild is a phone application aimed at creating open sourced building plans to build on the vacant lots in Detroit. To do this, anyone with the app could work on projects and architectural plans so that building ideas could be created free of charge. In doing my research, I realized that one of the major reasons why buildings werent going up in the vacant lots was that the government didn't want to put money into projects to rebuild lower socioeconomic status areas. To combat this, I wanted a way to decrease the costs any way I could. I also wanted to avoid branching into the zone of gentrification. To do this, Rebuild will allow you to employ members of the community to help construct the buildings. This will help employ people who may be un- or under- employed and teach them a valuable skill that can potentially help them get a job. With a job comes money, with money comes the ability to by property, so the buildings being created can stay in the hands of the original community members.
